The probability is depended on the state the molecule is in at that specific time (molecules have multiple-state). Additionally, ''pseudo-molecules'' are introduced to the system in order to simulate unimolecular reactions. For simulation, continuous time is broken down into disrete, independent ''slices''. During each time slice one molecule is selected randomly, a second molecule or pseudo-molecule is selected afterwards (leading to either a unimolecular or a bimolecular reaction). The reaction will only take place if a produced random number exceeds the reaction probability calculated beforehand. In that case, the system is updated after that reaction."

def: "The explicit tau-leaping procedure attempts to speed up the stochastic simulation of a chemically reacting system by approximating the number of firings of each reaction channel during a chosen time increment Tau as a Poisson random variable. Since the Poisson random variable can have arbitrarily large sample values, there is always the possibility that this procedure will cause one or more reaction channels to fire so many times during Tau that the population of some reactant species will be driven negative. Two recent papers have shown how that unacceptable occurrence can be avoided by replacing the Poisson random variables with binomial random variables, whose values are naturally bounded. This paper describes a modified Poisson tau-leaping procedure that also avoids negative populations, but is easier to implement than the binomial procedure. The new Poisson procedure also introduces a second control parameter, whose value essentially dials the procedure from the original Poisson tau-leaping at one extreme to the exact stochastic simulation algorithm at the other; therefore, the modified Poisson procedure will generally be more accurate than the original Poisson procedure."

def: "LSODPK, written jointly with Peter N Brown, is a set of FORTRAN subroutines for solving the initial value problem for stiff and nonstiff systems of ordinary differential equations. In solving stiff systems, LSODPK uses a corrector iteration composed of Newton iteration and one of four preconditoned Krylov subspace iteration methods. The user must select the desired Krylov method and supply a pair of routine to evaluate, preprocess, and solve the (left and/or right) preconditioner matrices. Aside from preconditioning, the implementation is matrix-free, meaning that explicit storage of the Jacobian (or related) matrix is not required. The method is experimental because the scope of problems for which it is effective is not well-known, and users are forewarned that LSODPK may or may not be competitive with traditional methods on a given problem. LSODPK also includes an option for a user-supplied linear system solver to be used without Krylov iteration." [, http://www.nea.fr/abs/html/uscd1231.html ""]

LSOIBT treat systems in the linearly implicit form A(t,y) dy/dt = g(t,y), A = a square matrix, i.e. with the derivative dy/dt implicit, but linearly so. It allows A to be singular, in which case the system is a differential-algebraic equation (DAE) system. In that case, the user must be very careful to supply a well-posed problem with consistent initial conditions. LSOIBT, written jointly with C. S. Kenney, solves linearly implicit systems in which the matrices involved are all assumed to be block-tridiagonal. Linear systems are solved by the LU method. The LSOIBT source is commented extensively to facilitate modification. Both a single-precision version and a double-precision version are available." [, http://www.nea.fr/abs/html/uscd1226.html ""]

If accuracy is set to at least 3, then it will also occur if A and B are in nearest-neighbor virtual boxes. If it is at least 7, then the reaction will happen if they are in nearest-neighbor boxes that are separated by periodic boundary conditions. And if it is 9 or 10, then all edge and corner boxes are checked for reactions, which means that no potential reactions are overlooked. Overall, increasing accuracy numbers lead to improved quantitative bimolecular reaction rates, along with substantially slower simulations.
