# KiSAO

The Kinetic Simulation Algorithm Ontology (KiSAO: http://co.mbine.org/standards/kisao) is an ontology of algorithms for simulating and analyzing biological models, as well as the characteristics of these algorithms, their input parameters, and their outputs. In addition, KiSAO captures relationships among algorithms, their parameters, and their outputs.

## Browsing KiSAO

KiSAO can be browsed through [BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/KISAO) and [OLS](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/kisao).

## Browsing the substitutability of algorithms catalogued by KiSAO

A report of the substitutability of algorithms catalogued by KiSAO is available [here](https://github.com/SED-ML/KiSAO/blob/dev/libkisao/python/docs/algorithm-substitutability.csv).

## Obtaining KiSAO in other formats

KiSAO is developed in the OWL format. The current release of KiSAO is available in OWL format [here](https://github.com/SED-ML/KiSAO/tree/dev/kisao.owl). KiSAO is available in CSV and RDF/XML formats from [BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/KISAO).

## Working with KiSAO in code

A package is available for working with KiSAO in Python: https://github.com/SED-ML/KiSAO/tree/dev/libkisao/python.

A older package is available for working with KiSAO in Java: https://co.mbine.org/standards/kisao/libkisao.

## Obtaining older versions of KiSAO

The current release of KiSAO is available in the OWL format [here](https://github.com/SED-ML/KiSAO/tree/deploy/kisao.owl). The current development version is available [here](https://github.com/SED-ML/KiSAO/tree/dev/kisao.owl). Older versions of KiSAO are available [here](https://github.com/SED-ML/KiSAO/releases). All versions are available in OWL format. Versions 1.0 is also available in OBO format.
